# Using Anonymous Classes

**Anonymous Classes -** Class without a name 
    * easy way to encapsulate read-only properties into single object without defining a type
    * type of each property included in class will be inferred by compiler
    ```anAnonoymousObject = new { Name = "Tom", Age = 65 };```
